![alt text](https://github.com/StevenJDH/TimeStamp-Changer/raw/master/timestampchangerss.jpg "Screenshot")

This is a GUI to easily change the timestemp on any file using native functions. I was prompted to build this to see if it was possible using managed code rather than the more common method of using Windows APIs, which could break in the future.
